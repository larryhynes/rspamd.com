# Mail list module

Mailing list module is a simple module that performs checks whether a message is
sent over some popular mailing lists software. This module is designed to negate
some rules as they are likely to be touched unnecessarily if a message comes from
some list.

Here is a list of currently supported mailing lists programs:

- Ezmlm
- Mailman
- Google groups
- Majordomo
- Communigate PRO mailing lists
- subscribe.ru mailing list
