# Rmilter - Rspamd milter

## Introduction

Rmilter is used to integrate rspamd and `milter` compatible MTA, for example [postfix](http://postfix.org) or [sendmail](http://sendmail.org).
Rmilter can also do other useful stuff:

-   Clamav scanning (via unix or tcp socket).
-   Rspamd scanning
-   Greylisting with redis upstream
-   Ratelimit with redis upstream
-   Auto-whitelisting (internal and via redis upstream)
-   Replies check (whitelisting replies to sent messages)
-   Passing messages and/or their headers to beanstalk servers


All `rmilter` configuration is placed in rmilter.conf file.

## Configuration format

The configuration file has format:

    name = value ;

Value may be:

-   String (may not contain spaces)
-   Quoted string (if string may contain spaces)
-   Numeric value
-   Flag (`yes`/`no` or `true`/`false`)
-   IP or network (eg. `127.0.0.1`, `192.168.1.0/24`, `[::1]/128`)
-   Socket argument (eg. `host:port` or `/path/to/socket` or `fd:3` for systemd socket)
-   Regexp (eg. `/Match\*/`)
-   List (eg. `value1, value2, value3`)
-   Recipients list (`user, user@domain, @domain`)
-   Time argument (eg. `10s`, `5d`)

Some directives MUST be specified only in specified sections. Section
definition looks like:

     section_name {
             section_directive;
             ...
     }

## Common sections

-   clamav - clamav definitions

## Limits section

Rate limits are implemented as leaked bucket, so first value is
bucket burst - is peak value for messages in bucket (after reaching
it bucket is counted as overflowed and new messages are rejected),
second value is rate (how much messages can be removed from bucket
each second). It can be schematically displayed as following:

![Leaked bucket scheme](https://rspamd.com/img/rspamd-schemes.006.jpg "Leaking bucket")

- `limit_bounce_to`: limits bucket for bounce messages (only rcpt to)
	+ Default: `5:0.000277778`
- `limit_bounce_to_ip`: limits bucket for bounce messages (only rcpt to per one source ip)
	+ Default: `5:0.000277778`
- `limit_to`: limits bucket for non-bounce messages (only rcpt to)
	+ Default: `20:0.016666667`
- `limit_to_ip`: limits bucket for non-bounce messages (only rcpt to per one source ip)
	+ Default: `30:0.025`

	+ Default: `100:0.033333333`

## DKIM section

Dkim can be used to sign messages by. Dkim support must be
provided by opendkim library.

- `header_canon`: canonization of headers (simple or relaxed)
    + Default: `simple`
- `body_canon`: canonization of body (simple or relaxed)
    + Default: `simple`
- `sign_alg`: signature algorithm (`sha1` and `sha256`)
    + Default: `sha1`
- `auth_only`: sign mail for authorized users only
    + Default: `yes`
- `domain`: domain entry must be enclosed in a separate section
    +   `key` - path to private key
    +   `domain` - domain to be used for signing (this matches with SMTP FROM data). If domain is `*` then rmilter tries to search key in the `key` path as `keypath/domain.selector.key` for any domain.
    +   `selector` - dkim DNS selector (e.g. for selector *dkim* and domain *example.com* DNS TXT record should be for `dkim._domainkey.example.com`).
- `sign_networks` - specify internal network to perform signing as well
	+ Default: `empty`

## The order of checks

1.  DKIM test from and create signing context (MAIL FROM)
2.  Ratelimit (RCPT TO)
3.  Greylisting (DATA)
4.  Ratelimit (EOM, set bucket value)
5.  Rules (EOM)
6.  SPF (EOM)
7.  Message size (EOM) if failed, skip clamav, dcc and spamd checks
8.  DCC (EOM)
10. Rspamd (EOM)
9.  Clamav (EOM)
11. Beanstalk (EOM)
12. DKIM add signature (EOM)

## Keys used in redis

-   *rcpt* - bucket for rcpt filter
-   *rcpt:ip* - bucket for rcpt_ip filter
-   *rcpt:ip:from* - bucket for rcpt_ip_from filter
-   *rcpt:* - bucket for bounce_rcpt filter
-   *rcpt:ip:* - bucket for bounce_rcpt_ip filter
-   *md5(from . ip . to)* - key for greylisting triplet (hexed string of
    md5 value)

## Postfix settings

There are several useful settings for postfix to work with this milter:

    smtpd_milters = unix:/var/run/rmilter/rmilter.sock
    milter_mail_macros =  i {mail_addr} {client_addr} {client_name} {auth_authen}
    milter_protocol = 6

## Useful rmilter recipies

This section contains a number of useful configuration recipies and best practices for rmilter.

### Setup DKIM signing of outcoming email for authenticated users

With this setup you should generate keys and store them in `/etc/dkim/<domain>.<selector>.key`
This could be done, for example by using `opendkim-genkey`:

    opendkim-genkey --domain=example.com --selector=dkim

That will generate `dkim.private` file with private key and `dkim.txt` with the suggested `TXT` record for your domain.

    dkim {
        domain {
          key = /etc/dkim;
          domain = "*";
          selector = "dkim";
        };
        header_canon = relaxed;
        body_canon = relaxed;
        sign_alg = sha256;
    };

Please note, that rmilter will sign merely mail for the **authenticated** users, hence you should also ensure that `{auth_authen}` macro
is passed to milter on `MAIL FROM` stage:

    milter_mail_macros =  i {mail_addr} {client_addr} {client_name} {auth_authen}

### Setup whitelisting of reply messages

It is possible to store `Message-ID` headers for authenticated users and whitelist replies to that messages by using of rmilter. To enable this
feature, please ensure that you have `redis` server running and add the following lines to redis section:

    redis {
      ...
      # servers_id - redis servers used for message id storing, can not be mirrored
      servers_id = localhost;

      # id_prefix - prefix for extracting message ids from redis
      # Default: empty (no prefix is prepended to key)
      id_prefix = "message_id.";
    }

Back to [top](#).

### Mirror some messages to evaluate rspamd filtering quality

Sometimes it might be useful to watch how messages are processed by rspamd. For this purposes, rmilter
can mirror some percentage of messages to [beanstalk](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/) service and check them using rspamc.
First of all, install `beanstalk` in your system (in this example I assume that beanstalk is running on port 11300). Then grab
a small routine [bean-fetcher](https://github.com/vstakhov/bean-fetcher). This routine would get messages from beanstalk and feed them to
rspamc. Here is an example configuration file:

~~~ini
[instance1]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 11300
command = /usr/bin/rspamc --mime --ucl --exec '/usr/lib/dovecot/dovecot-lda -d user'
~~~

It is also possible, for example, to compare output for different rspamd versions or rules sets:

~~~ini
[instance1]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 11300
command = [ "/usr/bin/rspamc --mime --ucl --exec '/usr/lib/dovecot/dovecot-lda -d user1'", "/usr/bin/rspamc -h other_host:11333 --mime --ucl --exec '/usr/lib/dovecot/dovecot-lda -d user2'" ]
~~~

Then setup rmilter to mirror some traffic:

~~~
beanstalk {
  copy_server = localhost:11300;
  send_beanstalk_copy = yes;
  # Please note that copy probability is floating point number from 0.0 to 1.0
  copy_probability = 0.1;
}
~~~

Afterwards, it might be useful also to setup dovecot-sieve for sorting messages between folders by their spam scores:

~~~
require ["copy", "fileinto"];

if header :contains "X-Spam-Symbols" "BAYES_SPAM" {
        fileinto :copy "bayes_spam";
}
if header :contains "X-Spam-Symbols" "BAYES_HAM" {
        fileinto :copy "bayes_ham";
}

if header :is "X-Spam-Action" "reject" {
        fileinto "Spam";
}
if header :is "X-Spam-Action" "add header" {
        fileinto "Probable";
}
if header :is "X-Spam-Action" "no action" {
        fileinto "Ham";
}
if header :is "X-Spam-Action" "greylist" {
        fileinto "Greylist";
}
~~~

This script sort messages according their spam action and also copies messages with statistics symbols `BAYES_HAM` and `BAYES_SPAM` to the appropriate folders for further analysis.
