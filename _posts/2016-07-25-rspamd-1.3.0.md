Today, we've released major updates for both Rspamd and Rmilter: Rspamd is updated to version 1.3 and Rmilter is updated to version 1.9. These updates include many new features, including Rspamd proxy and fuzzy storage mirroring. Here is the list of the most important changes introduced in Rspamd 1.3:

### Rspamd proxy support

We understand the importance of testing when building spam filtering engines. Most testing work requires checking with production mail flows. The idea behind Rspamd proxy is to create a lightweight shim that can forward requests to the main Rspamd instance and mirror a certain percentage of mail to some testing environment and compare scan results afterwards. Moreover, Rspamd proxy can encrypt traffic and provide zero-copy forwarding for local connections. You can read more about Rspamd proxy in the [media](/media.html) section where there is a link to a presentation that describes proxy features in detail.

### Fuzzy storage mirroring

[Fuzzy hashes](/doc/modules/fuzzy_check.html) are a powerful method to filter spam mail. In version 1.3, Rspamd supports hash mirroring enabling master-slave replication for different storages. Furthermore, it is possible to organise collections of hashes from multiple sources. The synchronization structure is quite simple but it allows for building distributed systems providing the necessary level of redundancy and security. All these features are described in the [fuzzy storage operational guide](/doc/fuzzy_storage.html).

### HTTPS maps support

Rspamd now supports `HTTPS` protocol when accessing HTTP resources. That allows for creation of maps that can query `HTTPS` resources, for example, there is now support for [OpenPhish](https://openphish.com) and [PhishTank](https://phishtank.com) feeds in the [phishing module](/doc/modules/phishing.html).

### Redis replication support

It is now possible to use [Redis](https://redis.io) cluster in all Rspamd modules, since Redis requests are split between `read_servers` and `write_servers`. Another useful addition is the ability to specify Redis servers in a dedicated section to configure all modules that use Redis together. You can read more information about it in the [Redis integration guide](/doc/configuration/redis.html).

### Improved content filtering

There are many features added to the [`multimap`](/doc/modules/multimap.html) and [`mime_types`](/doc/modules/mime_types.html) plugins. 

First of all, Rspamd can now read files list from some archives types, namely, `zip` and `rar`. This feature allows to ban some certain bad attachments that could be archived (or even encrypted) by spammers. Since archives are the main source of malware this feature should be extremely useful in filtering these sort of malicious messages. `Mime_types` plugin is updated to find the following bad patterns:

* archive in archive
* double extension to hide malware (e.g. `pdf.exe`)
* certain list of blacklisted extensions (user's configurable)

Secondly, multimap plugin can now scan message content. This allows you to create, for example, regular expressions map (powered by [Hyperscan](https://01.org/hyperscan/) that can filter messages using a a comprehensive list of bad patterns.

There are a couple of other improvements to the multimap module, for example, new filters and map deduplication.

### Internal greylisting support

Rspamd can now delay suspicious messages internally. In earlier versions, you would require some external tool (for example, Rmilter) to do this job for Rspamd. Since 1.3, you can do this task just within Rspamd regardless of the integration method you use.

### Replies module

Similarly to the previous module, this Rmilter feature is now available within Rspamd. By means of this module, Rspamd can store our outgoing email IDs and automatically whitelist external replies to these messages. This feature allows for immediate delivery of replies, automatic notifications and bounces for local users.

### DKIM signatures support

Rspamd now supports DKIM signing in addition to DKIM checks. Signing condition is defined by a custom Lua script that allows to select conditions for signing, the appropriate signing key and selector all by using Rspamd Lua API features. There are a couple of examples that are provided in the module's [documentation](/doc/modules/dkim.html). `rspamadm` utility can now generate DKIM key pairs and DNS records for your domains.

### WebUI improvements

There are various improvements in the Rspamd web interface. For example, it now includes a throughput graph powered by [d3.js](https://d3js.org) and the custom module contributed by Alexander Moisseev. You can now also learn fuzzy using WebUI and there are many bugs and visual issues fixed in this version.

### Other changes

Rspamd 1.3 also includes other changes that improve stability, filtering quality and performance, for example faster hash function selection. There are many critical bug fixes that were not backported to the 1.2 branch, for instance, major Redis statistics rework (which can now be used in highly loaded production environments). Many rules have been rescored and reworked. There are also many bug fixes to the URL detection logic and phishing detection. The [`chartable`](/doc/modules/chartable.html) module has been completely rewritten to provide more useful homograph detection. There are massive changes to the documentation: new guides, better [FAQ](/doc/faq.html) section and completely reworked [Rmilter](/rmilter/) section.

**WARNING**: There are a couple of incompatible changes for Rmilter, so please take a look at [the migration document](/doc/migration.html).
